## Let me introduce Myself
`My quest to become a Tech Expert started in 2021. I started researching about Tech in this year, and I found the data field interesting. Since I am skilled in writing, a dedicated my Medium page to writing about Tech, especially Data Analysis. By the following year, I had found online platforms like Simplilearn, Udemy, DataCamp, and Coursera where I started taking short courses in Data Science and Data Analytics. I also suscribed to Youtube channels where I started learning to use Excel and Python. By the end of 2022, I enrolled for and completed my first Data Analytics program. In this same period, I came across Azubi Africa's Data Analytics Program, which I applied for and was accepted.`

## How would I describe my experience in the data analytics program ?Â 
`Azubi Africa's Data Analytics Program was the game changer in my data journey. I got exposed to experienced teachers, who taught with so much passion and dedication. The program was really deep as I learnt how to work with various tools like Excel, SQL, Power BI, and Python. For me, the greatest highlight of this program is the exposure it gave me to Machine Learning, an area I have come to love.`

## How would I say the Career Accelerator phase has introduced me to when it comes to data analytics ?Â 
`The initiative to have a Career Accelerator Phase in the program is golden. This phase made me put in real work. For the first time, I was allowed to build projects, with the guidance of our instructors. The interactions between the instructors and learners through the Team and Engineering Demo sessions were stellar`
